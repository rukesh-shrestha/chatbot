Human:Hey worldink. I want to know about your FUP Policy. 
Reply: Sir, FUP is right that every ISP reserve. We are sure sooner or later it is going to be implemented by any ISPs according to their needs and requirements. So on with the increasing number of clients in WorldLink We intend to provide the best possible Internet experience to all our customers. For this, we rely on customers being fair in the way they use the Internet. This "Fair Usage Policy" is here to give us an option that if usage of any unlimited customer is excessive over a period of time to the point, it impacts on other users experience then the bandwidth will be capped to fallback speed and is effective only during peak hours (8PM to 11PM) whereas the speed remain unchanged beside mentioned timing.All of our valued clients must be able to use equal service. Here, FUP is an option to provide such solutions. There are so many users found they have been misusing internet e.g taking a connection for home and have been using for HOSTELS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS, Multiple sharing and for other business purposes. If you take a deep look into it a normal users never falls under FUP but all those bandwidth abusers and massive users.Let us take 5 Mbps package, when the internet usage exceeds the Daily FUP limit of 10 GB then FUP will be applied during the Daily peak hours ( i.e. 8 PM to 11 PM ), then the respective User will be notified via SMS and E-Mail. This will be done 3x3 times for every 10GB bandwidth usage during the Daily Peak Hours with SMS & Email Alert. For the next 3 times of 10 GB bandwidth usage, the bandwidth will then be capped to Fallback Speed ( 1 Mbps) but Users can reset the speed back to normal through Mobile App or visiting our Website. If the user continues with excessive use then the bandwidth will be capped again permanently ( i.e for 3 hours).when the internet usage is seen excessive then the respective users will be notified via SMS and E-Mail for 3 times, Users can reset the speed back to normal via bandwidth selector option available in online service or mobile app for next 3 times. FUP will be abolished as user manage his/her daily usage, If continuous excess usage is seen then the bandwidth will be capped permanently( i.e 8PM-11PM hours only).Dear sir, Its warning message for all of our customers with excessive internet usage.
