Human: I heard from my friend that we can pair the TV remote with the nettv remote. Is that true?
Reply: Pairing IPTV and TV remote. 1. So, first of all you need to keep pressing SET of IPTV remote until the light stops blinking and light glows constantly. 2. And now keep both remote in such a way that both LED is facing each other. 3. Keep pressing AV/TV button of IPTV remote and same button of your TV remote until the light of IPTV remote glows constantly 4. Do the same process for all other buttons i.e Volume down, Volume up and Power button. Select the channel from menu key and there appears "wait to load epg/dvr" and when its loaded, you can select the channels.
