Human: That not fair. We have pay the amount you have declare.
Reply: We have provided the router in rental. Due to security purpose, you are not able to access the router page.
Human: Is there any way to access the router?
Reply: No sir/mam there is none of the way.
Human: I want to access my router.
Reply: We appreciate your query and glad that you brought it forward. The access to ONT devices from client's end was restricted due to security issues and rental policy of the company. There were multiple cases where unknown people created multiple SSID and misused volume and bandwidth at client's end resulting slow and intermittent connection. However, the sweet part is that you can use our mobile app "MyWorldLink" to change your Wi-Fi password, keep an eye on your DHCP list, account history, eService and all. We also would like to inform you that there are features like MAC filtering and reboot options available in mob app itself.
