Hey my intenet in working slow.,Please elaborate your issue sir/mam.
I am not getting the speed i am paying amount to you.,"5Mbps = 5120Kbps5120Kbps /8 = 640 KBps Well, since you have subscribed to our bandwidth in Bits per second. Then your actual download/upload speed should be the division of your subscribed internet speed by 8 [since 1 byte = 8 bit ] to get your speed in bytes per second (KBps). For example, If you subscribe the internet of 5 Mbps (Megabit per second) which is [ 5*1024=5120 Kbps (kilobits per second)] , then the download/upload speed should be around (5120/8) KBps i.e around 640 KBps (kilobytes per second).The download speed you are getting is in BYTES and the internet speed you are subscribed in BITS. It takes 8 BITS of Internet speed to download 1 BYTE of file size. But, while testing speed if you are not getting full BANDWIDTH, there could have been some issues, we can look into it and fix it for you.Sir, Download speed matters by BITS and BYTES factors. It take 8BITS of Internet speed to download 1BYTE of data. If you take 5mbps plan your internet speed will be 5120KBITS.Sir, it also depends very much  on the destination servers to which you are uploading your files too."

"Hey, i am not getting the speed that i supposed to get as well as i have facing issue in the connection.",Please elaborate your query sir.
I am using torrent and my internet is slow.,"Internet is provided in bits where as your download speed is displayed in Bytes. The average download speed of 5 Mbps (Megabits ) is 640 KBps ( KiloBytes). But it also may vary according to seeds and peers as well as server you're downloading from. Please inbox us your username. We will look into your issue.Sir/mam, Number of seeds and peers do affects the download reliability with respond to it's number. Greater seed/peer, the download ratio increase as per it. Perhaps, bandwidth that you have subscribed to is always that matters with the download speed. If the file you want to download have seeds and peers around 100 then according to your bandwidth subscribed your download should be around 640 KBps (which is equal to 5 Mbps) . Since there was just 50kbps download from your router, there must be an issue with it's throughput. Sir/mam, no ISP can guarantee the download speed you get in torrent. Its illegal to begin with, in many countries.  There is no specific server to store a torrent file. Bits and fragments of the file are scattered all over the world in the PC's of people who download those torrent files as seeders and leechers. People(leachers) download from you, when you are seeding a file. So the download speed from torrent very much depends on the number of seeders and leechers associated with the torrent file and the route to them.Well, since most of the downloader (eg IDM, torrent) shows the download speed in Byte per second but you have subscribed to our bandwidth in Bit per second. Then your actual download speed should be the division of your subscribed internet speed by 8 [since 1 byte = 8 bit ]. For example, If you subscribe the internet of 25 Mbps (Megabit per second) , then the download speed should be around (25/8) KBps i.e around 3.25MBps (MegaByte per second)."
ummm,Okay sir/mam
"Worldlink, I am facing slow internet connection.",Please elaborate your query sir.
I check the speed of my connection from the different speedtest and it shows the full speed  but while i ma downloading the content from the web site. It is downloading in 23 KB/s.,Please reboot your router and check.
I have already reboot the router and check.,Sir/mam If you don't mind please pause the download and download the demo ubuntu disk image from the concern web site.
Okay please wait for the while.,Okay sir/mam
The downloaing speed is good in that concern website.,Sir/mam the download speed also matter from the server.If the server has limit the speed. We can't do anything. As you have already tested the speed as well as the download speed of the other site too. There is no issue from the ISP site.
Thank you for your coorporation and guidance.,Welcome sir.
Hey worldink. I want to know about your FUP Policy.,"Sir, FUP is right that every ISP reserve. We are sure sooner or later it is going to be implemented by any ISPs according to their needs and requirements. So on with the increasing number of clients in WorldLink We intend to provide the best possible Internet experience to all our customers. For this, we rely on customers being fair in the way they use the Internet. This ""Fair Usage Policy"" is here to give us an option that if usage of any unlimited customer is excessive over a period of time to the point, it impacts on other users experience then the bandwidth will be capped to fallback speed and is effective only during peak hours (8PM to 11PM) whereas the speed remain unchanged beside mentioned timing.All of our valued clients must be able to use equal service. Here, FUP is an option to provide such solutions. There are so many users found they have been misusing internet e.g taking a connection for home and have been using for HOSTELS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS, Multiple sharing and for other business purposes. If you take a deep look into it a normal users never falls under FUP but all those bandwidth abusers and massive users.Let us take 5 Mbps package, when the internet usage exceeds the Daily FUP limit of 10 GB then FUP will be applied during the Daily peak hours ( i.e. 8 PM to 11 PM ), then the respective User will be notified via SMS and E-Mail. This will be done 3x3 times for every 10GB bandwidth usage during the Daily Peak Hours with SMS & Email Alert. For the next 3 times of 10 GB bandwidth usage, the bandwidth will then be capped to Fallback Speed ( 1 Mbps) but Users can reset the speed back to normal through Mobile App or visiting our Website. If the user continues with excessive use then the bandwidth will be capped again permanently ( i.e for 3 hours).when the internet usage is seen excessive then the respective users will be notified via SMS and E-Mail for 3 times, Users can reset the speed back to normal via bandwidth selector option available in online service or mobile app for next 3 times. FUP will be abolished as user manage his/her daily usage, If continuous excess usage is seen then the bandwidth will be capped permanently( i.e 8PM-11PM hours only).Dear sir, Its warning message for all of our customers with excessive internet usage. FUP have not been implemented. Whereas FUP policy is a worldwide policy and also mentioned in point no. 20 of terms and conditions.Let us take 5Mbps package, When the internet usage exceeds the Daily FUP limit of 28 GB within the Daily peak hours (i.e. 8PM-11PM), then the respective User will be notified via SMS and email. This will be done 3*3 times for every 28GB bandwidth usage during the Daily Peak Hours with SMS and Email Alert.

If the user continues with excessive use then the bandwidth will be capped again permanently (i.e. for 3 hours)At peak times, a lot of customers use the shared network bandwidth at any one time.This means that service quality for all users is affected, making it slower for everyone to access the internet or send and receive emails, especially at peak times.

How does a user fall under FUP?,If you want to understand about the FUP you have to read all the above information about the FUP.
Oh my God. How FUP works in WorldLink?,"Users who abuse the internet for immense download/upload uncontrollably, massive sharing & inappropriate package subscription."
How to avoid FUP?,"In WorldLink we have “SMART FUP” system which monitors our user’s behaviour, when a user exceeds daily data threshold, flags will be tagged automatically and on the basis of FLAGS tagged our system automatically restricts those abusers and keeps overall experience balanced for other normal users."
Are you kidding?,Subscribing to an appropriate internet plan is the best way to avoid FUP restrictions. A user can avoid FUP by keeping the track of D/U speed regularly. Also taking control over massive download and sharing.
You are such an insanse.,No sir.
Boro,Sorry.
Hey i want to know about the how does each flag work and what happen if a user is tagged by each flag?,Hello sir/mam. How can we assist you?
You really suprise me.,"sure sirAs we know that flags are triggered automatically according to the internet usages. YELLOW: If a user exceeds daily data limit during subscription days YELLOW FLAG will be tagged automatically. But our system will not notify or send EMAIL/SMS to those customers. Also internet speed will not be throttled or decreased. RED: If a user exceeds three YELLOW FLAGSduring subscription days RED FLAG will be tagged automatically. Such user’s internet speed will be temporarily throttled (capped) and starts running in FALLBACK SPEED, they will be notified via EMAIL/SMS. However, those users who are under RED FLAG can reset their internet speed back to normal simply by logging into online-services OR mobile app through bandwidth selector. We must insist customers to reboot their router to apply any changes made. BLACK: If a user exceeds three RED FLAGSduring subscription days BLACK FLAG will be tagged automatically. Their bandwidth will be throttled or decreased permanently, also these users will be notified through SMS/EMAIL but they won’t be able to reset the bandwidth by any means."
😡️😡️😡️😡️,okay sir/mam
How can i remove the FUP?,Hello sir/mam. How can we assist you?
Are you drunk?,"In WorldLink you will be notified by SMS about the FUP restrictions where you can still reset your bandwidth for three times even after you are under FUP possession.
